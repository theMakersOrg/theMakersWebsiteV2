description: >-
  TheMakers.org is a Not-For-Profit Maker Space that strives to give the community access to cutting edge technology, resources and know-how. If you don't have the space, equipment, or knowledge to realise your dreams or complete a project, perhaps we can help. 

  **Every Thursday evening we open our doors to the public** and welcome anyone and everyone to join us. Come see what all the fuss is about.

      heading: 3D Printer
      text: >
        One of the most recognised form of advanced manufacturing is the humble 
        3D printer. We have a variety of printers that are capable of printing 
        build sizes in excess of 340mm x 340mm x as long as you want (Blackbelt 3D)
        Or if resolution is your thing our Peopoly laser SLA (resin) 3D printer 
        is capable of as little as 5 micron layer heights is a build volume of 
        130mm x 130mm x 180mm. We also have some real experts in the area who 
        can help you.

        We have some powerful machines with some of the latest hardware dedicated 
        to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. If you 
        have a project or would simply like to chat with people in the field,
        drop in for a cuppa!

      heading: Be Creative
      text: >
        We are not just all tech nerds here! Many of our members are exploring 
        their creative sides and find the workspace and availability of tools 
        and expertise complimentary to creating. Some simply come for the room
        to work, others enjoy the cross pollination of ideas, technology and 
        experience.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_CNC.png
      heading: CNC Router / Mill
      text: >
        We have a 2.2Kw (spindle) CNC 2.5D mill (router) table that is capable of 
        soft materials such as wood, plastics, etc all the way to aluminium and 
        some of the softer grades of steel. The table fits a 1/4 standard sheet 
        of plywood, with the ability to process longer materials in a partitioned 
        manner.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_Community.png
      heading: Community
      text: >
        Community is at the heart of what we do, whether it is advice, experience,
        or just conversations with like minded individuals, a sense of community is key.
        Here at theMakers.org we pride ourselves on how keen we are to share and ensure 
        the sum of our parts is far greater than the sum of the individual qualities.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Cosplay.png
      heading: Cosplay
      text: >
        We have a variety of members that really enjoy this form of artistic expression 
        and creativity so we decided to mention it explicitly. Whether a seasoned artist or 
        a novice creator we are sure you will find someone or something here that will help
        you create.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Electronics.png
      heading: Electronics
      text: >
        Multiple soldering Irons, SMD rework hot air gun, Oscilloscopes, the list goes on...
        We really love electronics, if your into Arduino, Raspberry Pi's, sensors you will
        certainly love the facilities and talent we have. We can even help you develop circuit
        boards and even manufacture prototypes onsite, or provide this as a service.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_hand_tools.png
      heading: Hand Tools
      text: >
        No makerspace would be complete without a variety of hand tools to 
        compliment the more advanced manufacturing equipment. Including screwdrivers,
        socket sets, pliers, hammers, chisels, levels, rulers, saws, etc. Covering 
        working with metal, plastics, and timber
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_IoT.png
      heading: IoT
      text: >
        Everybody loves to talk about IoT but what is it really? We have a few makers that have worked in the field and have a strong understanding of
        the current state of the art. Well versed with LPWAN technologies all the way to displaying the data and gaining insight from it. We also host a "Things network" LORAWAN access point and fully support community driven as well as private/commercial projects.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Laser_Cutter.png
      heading: Laser Cutter
      text: >
        We love our laser cutter! Such a versatile and quick method of custom manufacturing. Our laser cutter is capable of approx 1500 x 900 cutting area. We also have attachments for working with cylindrical / rotational cutting and etching. most natural materials, plastics and fabrics are able to be processed, come have a chat to us if you have something in mind and we can help select materials etc, to ensure you get the product you want!
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Lathe.png
      heading: Lathe
      text: >
        Our metal lathe / mill combo is a pretty versatile machine that allows a manual processing of metals and plastics. We have a reasonably small but capable set of tools and accessories that make this the go-to tool form many types of material processing.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_Oscilloscope.png
      heading: Oscilloscope
      text: >
        When working with electronics or anything electrical the Oscilloscope is what really shows you what is going on. Most electronics give us little visual cues as to what is taking place in a circuit, this invaluable tool is great for diagnosing electronic faults and learning more about what is actually happening in circuit. We have both a CRO and a DSO available for use.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_power_tools.png
      heading: Power Tools
      text: >
        Drills, routers, saws, grinders, sanders, polishers, etc,. the list goes on and on... We have onsite a fairly comprehensive range of powered tools
        that make working with most materials a breeze. There is always a "right" tool for the job, so don,t let your project suffer needlessly let you skills shine. We also love to help people who are a little less confident but looking to learn.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Recycle.png
      heading: Recycling
      text: >
        We are firm believers of a recycling / reusing mindset and enjoy rebelling against the idea of a throw away society. We are currently working on a number of plastic recycling and processing ideas and projects and are actively looking for more people to help in this area.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_Robot.png
      heading: Robotics
      text: >
        All hail our robotic overlords! Long live the robots! We do not fear a robot uprising, in fact we love the potential that this areas has instore for our future. Come create and learn in this exciting field and help create a better future for yourself and human kind, whilst having a great time doing it.
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_Sewing.png
      heading: Sewing
      text: >
        We have some industrial sewing machines and overlockers that are great for all sorts of work including canvas and leather. Large areas to lay out material, why not even try using the Laser cutter to cut out your pattern 
        or a 3D printer to add some embellishments. Don't hold back your creativity
        and make something beautiful today!
    - image: /img/Icon_Blue_soldering.png
      heading: Soldering / PCB manufacture
      text: >
        From simple soldering some wires together, to SMD pcb work we have a variety of tools that make this process much more simple and give your project a professional look. We also have many years experience creating circuit boards and working with custom electronics. Our in house capabilities can create SMD boards with a solder mask perfect for prototypes and one offs.
    - image: /img/Icon_Red_vinyl_cutter.png
      heading: Vinyl Cutter / Plotter
      text: >
        Why not put a sticker on it! We have a vinyl cutter capable of 600m wide rolls that loves being used. We have used this machine with great success to

      Having given up on finding a community of makers in Cairns I was surprised in the best way ever once I came across theMakers.org. Instantly I knew I was home!

    quote: >-
      I didn't know what a makerspace was, a friend recommended them and I am so glad they did. I am so regularly at open nights I don't know what else I would do on a Thursday evening. :)
