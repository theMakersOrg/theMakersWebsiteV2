The evening was warm at another night at the Makers. Frigid air circulated the work room, the air conditioning bringing the temperature down to a degree that was almost too much for the tropical residence.

Here, you can see the templates that I (Evie) have been working on. The grooves in the rectangular shapes become what is called a living-hinge, allowing the MDF to fold over without snapping. These particular models unfortunately did not come out the right size for a reason that still remains a mystery. Pretty happy with how they're shaping up otherwise though!

Neil continues to print out his geographical art recreations â€“ Looking good! I'm looking forward to seeing all of it come together.

The Makers logo gets some attention as Matt M trials out some metal etching in an acidic solution. Pretty cool stuff.
