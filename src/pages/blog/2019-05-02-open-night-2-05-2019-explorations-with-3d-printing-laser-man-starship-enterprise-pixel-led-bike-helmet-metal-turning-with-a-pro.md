  Lots happening tonight. Turning a shaft on the lathe, experimentation in
  object orientation on one of the FDM 3D printers, construction of the start
  ship enterprise, and more ultra-fine 3D printing with the SLA printer.

## Explorations with 3D printing

By testing how different orientations effects the end result, the designer can improve and gain a better understanding of the process.



## Metal turning with a pro

We love it when people take the time to pass on their knowledge to others, here we have a prime example of open night attendees organically passing on their skills to anyone with an interest. This is the true maker spirit and we applaud those that live by it. :)

## Laser Man at it again!

Laser Man strikes again! not happy just blasting his creations into MDF and plywood, Laser Man gives the SLA printer a workout printing an ultra-fine pendant of his own creation.



## Star Ship Enterprise construction

Here we have a subscriber working on his starship that has been cut from 3mm MDF. Looks like it is coming along well. :)

## Pixel LED helmet

Here we have a quick fun piece done by[ Kurt](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/). It uses sculpted silicone spikes put onto pixel LED tape controlled by an ESP8266 and powered from a single 18650 battery, run time was about 3 hours.
