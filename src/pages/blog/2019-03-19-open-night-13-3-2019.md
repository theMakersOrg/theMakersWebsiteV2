# Laser Cut Lamp

After having some troubles with the design file last week, these makers were happy to successfully cut the parts for the lamp. We look forward to the updates as this lamp comes along...

# Giant LED Clock progress...

Here [Matt](https://themakers.org/bios/matthew-munsel/) continues to work on his giant LED clock. Here we see him controlling the colour of the strips(to be used in the clock) on a breadboard. The breadboard is just for prototyping and Matt has a Kicad design that will hopefully be ready for etching / milling soon. Yay!!!

# PID Temperature controller lets out the famous magic smoke...

Whilst continuing on the journey of building a filament extruder from scratch, [Kurt](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/) manages to appease the electronic gods by making a sacrifice to their eternal glory. We are hopeful that he can resurrect the temperature controller and continue on with the project...

If you look closely enough you can see the resistor has unwound due to over voltage.
