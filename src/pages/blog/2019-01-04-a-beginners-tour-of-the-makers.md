We will just take a **quick** look at all the maker space, and hopefully answer a couple of the questions you might have.

## What is a "maker space"

Due to the many different spaces out there it can sometimes be a little hard to pin down what a maker space is, so it is probably best to explain a little about our (your) maker space.

Quite simply it is a resource for the community, we provide a space in Cairns, Far North Queensland for anyone to be able to utilise, we also provide access to tools and machinery,a s well as providing a skills and experience pool to help you with your endeavours.

## Who are "the Makers"?

We are a registered Not For Profit Incorporated Association in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Officially registered in 2016 after the work of many people in the proceeding few years.

The Committee is made up of the following members:

- Matthew Ritchie - president
- Matthew Munsel - vice president
- Evie Wort - secretary
- Kurt Schoenhoff - treasurer

Our community is very strong and diverse, ranging from primary school age to retirees and our backgrounds and experience is equally as diverse. United by a love of making, for some that is sewing, for others that is 3D printing, yet others still it is cosplay, some just come to learn and share.

## Why is theMakers.org here?

This is the hardest question to answer in a quick way but I will try my best...

We are here to share, our (your) space, our (your) experience, our (your) equipment.

As a species we are on the brink if some radical changes that will change this planet and the human race forever, part of our reason for being here is democratise the technology and knowledge to use it and empower the community to do so.

## When?

Every Thursday we host an "open night" that anyone can attend, there is no need to RSVP, just come along after 5:30pm and be welcomed with a guided tour and introductions to those that are present. If you have a project bring it! If you dont, dont worry. :)

Our members and subscribers enjoy access to the space outside Thursday evenings, have a chat to a committee member for more info.
