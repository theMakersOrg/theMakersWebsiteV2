What a great turn out we had  on another successful open night and as usual the laser cutter was getting a good workout. 

Most of the night was spent working on personal projects, having a good chat and a few makerspace tours for those who have not seen our developing space.

Trying to unsuccessfully repair a monitor salvaged from the dump shop. All voltage rails present and accounted for but still no go.
