## Laser cut table decorations:

Some freshly cut table decorations being painted gold for their debut this weekend.

## CNC milling a PCB:

Using an isolation routing technique to create a prototype circuit board on the CNC router. Board layout was created in Eagle and milled using chillipeppr as the gcode generator and sender. A very quick way to have a circuit board ready to test in a matter of hours, great for performing prefabrication tests as well as usability tests quickly and cheaply.

## Raspberry Pi
Also had a few people setting up raspberry Pi's, some for the first time. One was just a straight Raspbian install. Another was a Raspbian along with MQTT and Homeassistant. Really love helping people getting these things up and running. :)
