## Extractor fans for the laser cutter

As you can see below, it is no wonder we were having some difficulty with smoke and fumes when laser cutting. A clean was well overdue. Thanks to [Matt Munsel](https://themakers.org/bios/matthew-munsel/) and [Kurt Schoenhoff](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/) the fans are back to 100% and as a bonus we now have a quieter workshop...

## LED Clock

Not afraid of large projects [Matt Munsell](https://themakers.org/bios/matthew-munsel/) is working on the design of a larger than life LED clock. The circuit uses 595s (shift registers) to drive some transistors (possibly changing to a darlington driver array) which switch the LEDS.



## Filament Extruder Hot End

having been mothballed for a little while, the filament extruder sees some more love as[ Kurt Schoenhoff](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/) spends some time manufacturing a hot end from some solid aluminium bar. The hot end has a 300w heater as well as a pt100 temperature sensor and will have PID control over the molten plastic to be extruded. The hot end will be wrapped in fibre glass insulation for efficiency and safety.
