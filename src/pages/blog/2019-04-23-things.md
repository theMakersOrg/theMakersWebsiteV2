It was a quieter night than usual, as you can tell by the smaller array of pizzas. Though no less productive!

Neil had his clear acrylic piece engraved and had placed white paint in the recess and wiped the excess off while it was drying to leave the colour behind. Quite a nifty idea.

A fellow came in who was interested in printing some prosthetic finger joints. We think they turned out rather well for a first test print!

Evie was using the laser for cutting boxes again. The hinge on this was was a little thin, so it doesn't close as nicely as it should.
Also, don't forget to double check your files, the skull symbol was meant for engraving only but somehow got tangled in the cut options too! (Oops)
