Having been approached by a local school [Kurt ](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/) is working on an OpenROV that was assembled by students, they were having a little trouble getting it up and running despite doing a great job of the assembly (a massive manual to put this guy together!!!). 

Apart from a few cabling issues the real problem was the Beagle Bone Black(BBB) was not booting correctly. After flashing the latest firmware on a MicroSD card it came alive!!! Problem was the BBB was not updating its internal flash from the MicroSD card. Not to worry, it still seems ok with just using the MicroSD card for now...

Hopefully it survives its sea trials!
