Well it started off as a quiet night.... However that was short lived and the night was another awesome one!

A quick drop in by [Clinton Freeman](https://reprage.com/) a fellow maker and artist who visits a little less often than he used to after moving up the hill. Always great to see your smiling face.

## Tropical Steampunk LED and control hacking

[Kurt](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/) has been busy hacking away at a recycled LED display, apparently from a decommissioned currency exchange display system. This relic from the past will be transported through time as it becomes a part of the tropical steam punk time machine. Featuring this Sunday at [Enviro Fiesta](https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/community-environment/sustainability/ecofiesta). It will also be on show with some tweaks later in the year at the Tropical [Steam Punk gig](https://www.facebook.com/events/141359416791581/187409232186599/?notif_t=plan_mall_activityÂ¬if_id=1559310587124641).

For technical details on the LEDS (de-multiplexing and addressing) and code just contact [Kurt](https://themakers.org/bios/KurtSchoenhoff/).

## Sand Walker

Some of our makers have been collaborating on a wind powered sand walker (Strand Beest inspired) Kinetic "Creature". It may not look like much currently however it should be quite impressive!
