For her first time at the makers this one certainly has taken to it like a duck to water. Have not used drawing software more elaborate what MS Paint, a little while on the laser cutting software and sheer determination has once again proven to triumph!

Sorry for the lack of photo's this week, some networking issues had my attention for most of the night and I completely forgot to take more. Just FYI there was also some shell carving by a local artist, 3D Printing (as usual), as well as the usual chit chat and catching up that happens every Thursday. :)
