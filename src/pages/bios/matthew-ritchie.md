Put a baby in sand and it will start to make, it's the human condition.  The choice is "Take" or "Make" --> "Consume" or "Create"?
Selfishness may permeate economics, but to design a better future we leave no creative warrior behind.  “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much”.  
The dream; a tropical paradise with the all tools, people, and opportunity to create our wildest dreams. So we did, and now we can.
Lifelong learning, creative endeavors, and a collective progress.  
Dream it, design it, make it, and pass those opportunities on.
