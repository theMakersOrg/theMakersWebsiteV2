Making stuff is awesome. I enjoy learning how to make things and figuring out how stuff works.
Normally I will have a few projects on the go at any one time. New ideas lead down different paths and sometimes I'll just keep going until I find my way around to where I was before.
I like to draw, paint, design, convert, sculpt and generally just like trying out or testing interesting things, and stuff!
Some of my other hobbies include video games, tabletop roleplaying and wargames, listening to a variety of music and currently delving into woodworking basics with the help of others and that of YouTube videos.
One of the things on my to-do list is to do more cosplay, eventually gaining enough skills to make a fully cast monster suit and silicone mask.
