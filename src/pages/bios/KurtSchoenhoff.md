# Who am I?

Does anyone ever really know the answer to this question?

# What do I do?

Hack the world! Not content with anything in the word, I choose to hack it for the better!

# Projects:

## Vacuum Former

![Laser cut Vacuum former, with spanner and small Easter island head used as forms in white plastic](/img/img_20190206_100043-collage.jpg "Laser cut vacuum former - with test piece.")

After looking at an empty milk bottle that was (almost) destined for the recycle bin, I decided to create a small vacuum former and see what could be done. **As it turns out quite a lot!**  

The frame was sized to use 1/2 the plastic cut out of an empty 2L milk bottle. Using a small toaster, a battery powered vacuum and some milk bottles and HDPE containers we managed to get some great detail from the form. Lots of potential here. :)

## Recycled Score keeper

![Recycled score keeper built with 7 segment LEDS](/img/img_20190225_153840-collage.jpg "Recycled score keeper built with 7 segment LEDS")

This project started as a desire to work with some 7 segment LEDs that originally were used in a currency exchange board (this one was displaying time I believe). After some initial exploration of how to get the board working I was inspired to create a more artistic and less engineering based item. Over 90% of this project is recycled, the batteries are from an old Dyson vacuum cleaner, the stand was a speaker A/B tester, the acrylic was from light panels and most of the wiring and electronics was recycled from various items. 

I deliberately kept the electronics exposed to help illustrate the use of recycled materials and the re-usability of what is normally considered "throw away".

## Upcycling old speakers to BluTooth

![Broken Self powered speakers being upcycled into Blutooth ones.](/img/img_20190110_093330-collage.jpg "Hacking broken speakers into the future... Blutooth.")

I have had these broken speakers kicking around for a while, They originally were used in a school but the amp failed (relatively common). The power supply was reused, a [DC to DC](https://nqmakersupplies.com.au/shop/product/dc-dc-power-supply-5a-116) converter was required as the voltage was a little high for the blutooth/amp module. They now live on my desk and are used as PC speakers!

## DIY Hydraulic Excavator

![Laser cut hydraulic excavator using syringes and 3D printed parts.](/img/img_20181218_142529-collage.jpg "Diy Hydraulic Excavator")

This was a challenging but fun project, starting with a thingiverse project the 3D printed parts were customised to fit the syringes and the SS rods reclaimed from toner cartridges. Needs some work as the syringes are not the best hydraulic pistons as they leak air when put under too much stress. Never the less it is a pretty good start and lots of fun getting the co-ordination to perform smooth motion. The axis on the controls actually matches what is in some commercial equipment. 

## Laser cut "GO" board

![Laser cut Go Board](/img/img_20181205_161233.jpg "Laser cut Go Board")
This was a project for a friend, the board is cut from 3mm acrylic and has been spray painted black, an additional 3mm MDF sheet was glued to this for extra support. Board pieces were cut from 3mm MDF and a pattern etched on one side. top if acrylic was vector etched and then white acrylic paint was rubbed into the etch. bottom of acrylic was etched before painting black, if you look closely you can see a dragon in the center of the board.

## Machine learning Rig

![Motherboard with dual cpu and a RTX2070 GPU](/img/img_20181130_083210.jpg "ML Rig sporting dual Xeons and a RTX2070 GPU ")

As I will be spending this year (end more) getting down and dirty with Deep Neural Networks, I decided that I would build a ML rig (hosted at theMakers) together for myself and others to use.

This unit has found itself a home in an old case and I am currently thinking of a design for the acrylic cover...
