Ever since I could hold a screwdriver I have always wanted to find out how stuff works, even to this day I enjoy taking stuff apart to see how it was made. I have always enjoyed sitting down with a electronics kit and spend a few hours building it and then not letting the magic smoke out, or taking a product apart and hacking it do something it was never designed to do. 

## What do I do:

By Day: One who does **precision guess work **based on **unreliable** data provided by those of questionable knowledge or in other words an Electrician.

By Night: Making projects that I find interesting or will help me learn a particular skill. 

\*Note\* Most of my projects are never finished or just finished enough to be working.

## Projects:

I also enjoy playing with Raspberry Pi  and Arduinos, I have combined these with one of my other interests of photography and built an Arduino controlled  water drop rig and a time lapse dolly.

![The base was made from laser cut 6mm MDF the track is made from some aluminium angle, the wheels were from an old auto door and the steppers and hardware were from an old makerbot thing-o-matic. ](/img/dollyrig.jpg "Camera Dolly")

![The water drop rig has a Arduino powered controller that powers a solenoid to drop some water through an IR break beam that then triggers external speedlite flash with the shutter on the camera. ](/img/waterdrop.jpg "Water Droplet Rig")
